\abstract{

The problem of random walks crops up throughout all of life.  A prime example is brownian motion: the motion of
particles suspended in a solution.  This motion seems random to an observer.  Upon further inspection one realizes 
this motion to be a result of the forces acting on each particle.  Gravitational attraction pulls each particle 
towards the center of our planet.  Various other forces, such as the Coulomb force between particles, also 
play a role in the overall motion that is observed.  Just like the motion itself, computers are unable to generate
genuinely random results.  Using various commands allows for the generation of pseudo-random numbers.  This is done 
using an algorithm that produces results based on the inital input, also called the 'seed'.  Each apparently random 
number generated by our program will always be generated if the same seed number is used.

\section{Introduction}

This weeks lab pertained to the apparent random motion of various things in everyday life.  Since computers are 
deterministic machines, they are unable to generate truly random numbers.  Rather, we use commands such as 
'drand48()' to have the computer generate a pseudo-random number.  Starting from a common seed value will always 
output the same results.  Therefore, results are reproducable rather than truly random.

\section{Computational problem}

Initally the program generated an uncorrelated set of coordinates.  The independence of these x, y pairs 
was resolved by first defining a randomly generated angle that would be used in the computation of both variables.  
We also bounded the motion from one step to the next by restricting each jump to a length of one unit step.  The 
number of steps taken was graphed against the distance each generated coordinate was from the origin.


    \subsection{Relevant equations}

The errors used in generating figures 1-6 were generated using:
\begin{equation}
\label{F}
 {r[i] \sqrt{Ntrials} \over (Ntrials)^{2}}
\end{equation}

\section{Analysis}

Figures 1-6 showed the number of steps graphed against the distance each new coordinate was from the origin, along 
with a best fit line.  Both reducing the number of trials and increasing the maximum number of steps causes the 
error to increase.  This is demonstrated by equation 1 and shown by compairing various figures.  The fitted 
exponent converges to 0.5 at a quicker rate, as the number of trials increases.

Figure 7 is a scatter plot of the endpoints of each trial in two dimensions.  As expected, this graph has a 
distribution that is most dense at the original, approaching an overall even distribution.  Since each unit step 
was taken using a random angle in any direction some steps would be in the opposite direction of the overall motion.  
These steps, occuring less frequently than those that followed the trend, would cause a decrease in the distance 
from the origin from one step to the next.  For this reason it is expected that the uniformity of the scatter plot 
would mimic figure 7.


\section{Conclusion}

It may be impossible for computers to generate truly random numbers but using large prime seeds allowed 
this program to output coordinates with seemingly zero coorelation to each subsequent set.  The generation 
of pseudo-random numbers is extremely benefitial in modeling certian behaviors.
